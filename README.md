# üç≥ Recipe Finder - My First Web Project
Created for Maryori Torres my WDD 330 class - ¬© 2025

This is my very first web development project! I wanted to build something useful that could help people (like me) who struggle to decide what to cook.

## Features
- Search recipes using ingredients you already have
- Save your favorite recipes (they'll stay even if you close the browser)
- Plan meals for the week with drag-and-drop
- "Surprise Me!" button suggests random recipes when you can't decide
- Works on phones, tablets, and computers

## How To Use It
1. Type what's in your fridge (ex: "chicken, tomatoes")
2. Hit Search or press Enter
3. Click "Add to Plan" to schedule meals for the week
4. Drag recipes to different days if you change your mind
5. Click the heart icon to save favorites

## Tech Stuff I Used
- HTML/CSS (still learning Grid/Flexbox)
- JavaScript (async/await was confusing but I got it!)
- Flask for local testing (Python is new to me)
- Edamam API (got 10,000 free requests/month)
- localStorage to save your data

## Challenges I Faced
1. The drag-and-drop was really hard! I watched many tutorials to get it working.
2. Making it work on mobile took several tries.
3. Sometimes the API doesn't return results and I had to learn error handling.
4. localStorage was tricky at first but now I understand it better.

## What I Learned
- How to use APIs with JavaScript
- Responsive design principles
- Event handling in JavaScript
- How to persist data without a database
- Debugging with console.log() is my best friend!
