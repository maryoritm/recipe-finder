üç≥ Recipe Finder - My First Web Project
Created for Maryori Torres my WDD 330 class - ¬© 2025

This is my very first web development project! I wanted to build something useful that could help people (like me) who struggle to decide what to cook.

What It Does
Lets you search recipes using ingredients you already have

Filters for different diets (I added vegetarian/vegan options first)

Works on phones too (took me 3 tries to get the mobile layout right üòÖ)

How To Use It
Type what's in your fridge (ex: "chicken, tomatoes")

Hit Search (I almost forgot to add the button at first!)

Click on recipes you like to see directions

Tech Stuff I Used
HTML/CSS (still learning Grid/Flexbox)

JavaScript (async/await was confusing but I got it!)

Flask for local testing (Python is new to me)

Edamam API (got 10,000 free requests/month)
